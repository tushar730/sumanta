The structure design of the smart sock prototype integrated with stretchable hybrid electronic
temperature sensing yarn for real-time temperature monitoring
Pervasive and Mobile Computing, Volume 116, March 2026, 102136
Online Link: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmcj.2025.102136

Rapid advances in electronic textiles have enabled the development of smart socks with temperature-sensing capabilities for real-time foot temperature monitoring, where
stretchability, user comfort, durability, bending, washability, sensing location error during wear, and higher manufacturing cost are drawbacks. This study introduces a smart
sock prototype that integrates highly stretchable hybrid electronic temperature-sensing (SHETS) yarns in key physiological foot regions—hallux, metatarsal, midfoot, and
heel—to detect temperature variations and address the challenges of exciting and commercial products. Structural design of SHETS yarns involved wrapping, novel
interconnection, encapsulation, and braiding techniques to integrate miniature thermistor within the yarn structure, showing high stretchability, durability, washability, and
sensing accuracy. Low-power microcontroller transmits analog data to a digital format, and the web-based interface enables users to monitor data through mobile phone
applications in real-time. The prototype demonstrates high accuracy, durability, and reliability under various conditions, with average temperature error ranging from
±0.23˚C to ±0.27˚C. The prototype maintains durability and stability in hot, cold, and sweaty conditions. Physical activities like walking, running, and cycling demonstrate the
durability and stability of foot temperature changes, while extended wear shows low power consumption and stability. The device withstands over 30 washing cycles with
minimal accuracy loss (maximum ±0.28˚C error) and retains the mechanical and electrical properties of SHETS yarn under repeated stretching and bending. Additionally, the
android-based intelligent foot alert system enhances usability by providing real-time monitoring and alerts on smartphones, offering a cost-effective, energy-efficient, and userfriendly solution for proactive foot health management.

Development of Durable and Stretchable Hybrid Electronic Yarns for Temperature
Measurement: Sensing and Mechanical Performance
Journal of Electronic Materials, Volume 54, pages 9744–9770, (2025), 07 August 2025
Online Link: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11664-025-12202-0

The development of durable and stretchable hybrid electronic yarn for precise temperature measurement in wearable textiles faces challenges such as
interconnection breakage, limited extensibility, and low mechanical stability. This study presents the development of durable, stretchable hybrid electronic
yarns (e-yarns) for accurate body temperature measurement in wearable textiles. This hybrid e-yarn comprises a pair of enamel copper wires wrapped
around a spandex core, interconnected to a surface-mounted negative temperature coefficient thermistor electronic component. A customized design of a
novel polytetrafluoroethylene mold-enabled interconnection technique ensures precise alignment and robust soldering. Preliminary and final encapsulation
techniques were used to increase the mechanical stability of the sensing yarn. Ultraviolet (UV) polyurethane acrylate (PUA), UV acrylic resin adhesives with
two diameters, and a polyethylene heat-shrink tube cured by UV and heat were used to evaluate the temperature-sensing performance of the yarn. A tubular
braiding structure with nylon threads further improved mechanical durability and textile-like properties. The results demonstrate that PUA encapsulation
with a small diameter is advantageous for achieving good temperature-sensing performance, with sensitivity of 2.961%/°C within a temperature range of 28–
45°C. Preliminary PUA encapsulation within a tubular braided structure demonstrated optimal sensing accuracy (± 0.65% error), sensitivity of 2.9493%/°C,
a hysteresis error of 2.214%, and response times of 6.4272 s (heating) and 26.2955 s (cooling). This structure achieved ideal equilibrium between precise
temperature-sensing accuracy and durable and stable functionality in tensile, bending, washing and drying, and textile-like properties, which are crucial for
monitoring human health.

Insertion of miniature electronic components into textile yarn structure for temperature
detection, sensing, and mechanical performance
Journal of Donghua University (English Edition)
Online Link:

The growing popularity of electronic textiles demands the insertion of miniature electronic components into textile yarns, where proper placement, short
circuits, broken interconnects, and insufficient mechanical performance are significant limitations. To accurately measure temperature and overcome these
limitations, an electronic hybrid temperature-sensing (EHTS) yarn has been developed. An electronic thread is wrapped around a polyester core yarn. A
novel interconnection technique for accurately soldering surface mount device (SMD) components, i.e., negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistors,
in the middle position of electronic threads effectively resolves issues related to improper component placement, short circuits, and broken interconnects. An
ultraviolet (UV) cured encapsulation process using polyurethane acrylate (PUA) UV-cured adhesive is employed to enhance the structural integrity of the
interconnect area. Similarly, using a two-component epoxy resin, a natural curing process encapsulates the soldering position. Moreover, a tubular braiding
structure is employed to create a textile-like texture and improve the yarn's durability against use, laundering, and external factors. Sensing and mechanical
performance are evaluated for all the preparation states of the samples. The results demonstrated that the unique structure of soldering with encapsulated
PUA adhesives within a braided configuration significantly enhances temperature sensing performance, exhibiting a sensitivity of 2.9482%/°C, rapid curing
speed, superior encapsulation structure, and overall cost efficiency compared with natural curing. This structure also demonstrates stable mechanical
performance, like electrical resistance and temperature changes under different loads, bending, twisting, washing, and drying conditions, making it
appropriate for accurate temperature sensing and long-lasting, textile-like qualities, which are critical for human health monitoring.

Design and evaluation of core–shell yarn-based triboelectric sensing fabric for human motion
monitoring
Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics, Volume 36, article number 220, (2025), 28 January 2025
Online Link: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10854-025-14228-w

Pressure sensor textiles are essential for smart textile development, but their creation is challenging due to cost and sensitivity requirements. This study
introduced a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of single triboelectric mode (STEM) versus double triboelectric modes (DTEM) sensing woven fabric
using core–shell yarn with nylon and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filaments. It explores three modes of triboelectric technology: (STEM) using a plain
weave pattern, (DTEM) utilizing two instances of the same plain weave pattern, and (DTEM) combining plain and twill weave patterns to improve
performance outcomes. The triboelectric fabric with plain structures (STEM) shows an initial output of 0.80 nA, rising to 1.50 nA when connected with two
plain structures. Incorporating one plain structure and one twill structure woven fabric (DTEM) further boosts the output to 1.80 nA. Notably, (DTEM)
achieves 0.80 nA and 1.50 nA outputs at 1 Hz and 2 Hz, respectively, with the highest output of 2.00 nA at 3 Hz. The sensor fabric demonstrates sensitivities
of 0.269 V/kPa−1 and 0.013 V/kPa−1 across pressure ranges from 0.22 to 0.44 kPa and 0.47 to 0.74 kPa. The adaptable, flexible, and lightweight apparatus
effectively tracks dynamic movements in human joints, spanning the knee, underarm, elbow, and hand, showcasing promise for multifunctional self-powered
pressure sensor textiles in smart textile applications.

Multifunctional W-TENG fabric sensor for comprehensive human motion monitoring:
integration of pressure, temperature and tension sensing
Journal of Materials Science, Volume 60, pages 19030–19048, (2025), 24 September 2025
Online Link: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10853-025-11044-9

Smart multifunctional wearable products are rapidly influencing consumer electronics market and provide innovative performance for various uses but
remain hindered by reliance on rechargeable batteries with limited lifespans and low energy storage. We addressed these challenges by developing a wovenstructured triboelectric nanogenerator (W-TENG) using commercially available nylon and polyester fabrics. Coated with carbon black and carbon nanotube
pastes containing sodium alginate, the fabrics demonstrated enhanced triboelectric performance while maintaining flexibility, breathability, and washability.
The freestanding triboelectric layer enabled electricity generation under various mechanical motions, making W-TENG highly compatible with wearable
devices. In testing, W-TENG achieved a peak current of 4 μA at 3 Hz using carbon black-coated fabrics, outperforming other configurations. Temperature
sensitivity tests showed a rise in current output from 0.002 μA at 25 °C to 0.023 μA at 45 °C, confirming its thermal efficiency. Tensile strain sensing tests
revealed that electrical output increased from 0.9 μA at 15% strain to 8 μA at 30% strain, showcasing its responsiveness to mechanical deformation. Motion
sensing trials using hands and elbows demonstrated a maximum current of 10.3 μA under slow movements. These results highlight W-TENG’s potential as a
self-powered, cost-effective solution for wearable electronics, enabling real-time energy harvesting and multifunctional sensing. This work paves the way for
sustainable, energy-autonomous smart textiles.

Gain enhancement through structural optimization of 100% textile-based microstrip
patch antennas for wearable applications at 2.45 GHz
Textile Research Journal, May 7, 2025
Online Link: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00405175251316319

This study enhances the gain of fabric-based wearable patch antennas at 2.45 GHz, crucial for improving wireless body area networks (WBANs)
used in health monitoring and fitness tracking. Unlike conventional antennas, which rely on high-conductivity metals and rigid substrates such as
flame retardant 4 (FR4) or printed circuit board (PCB), this study utilizes 100% textile materials, including denim as the substrate and diamond
lattice conductive fabric (DLCF) as the radiating element, offering flexibility and low-cost manufacturing due to its commercially availability.
Simulations demonstrated that increasing substrate thickness significantly improved gain, achieving up to 4.58 dB. Experimental validation with a
100% cotton-based substrate showed gains of 0.03, 2.18, and 3.82 dB for thickness increases of 1, 3, and 5 times, respectively. Despite the lower
conductivity of textile materials, the optimized antenna structure exhibited performance comparable to conventional antennas. This work highlights
the potential for fully textile-based, high-gain antennas that are both flexible and cost-effective, making them viable for scalable wearable
applications.

Eco-friendly Sustainable Dyeing of Lycra Viscose Fabric with Allium sativum Using Natural
and Metal Mordants
Fibers and Polymers, Volume 25, pages 3887–3900, (2024), 18 September 2024
Online Link: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12221-024-00710-5

Due to its many practical advantages and positive effects on the environment, sustainable dyeing using natural substances has drawn increased attention.
Based on the sustainability of the extraction of natural dyestuff from garlic (Allium sativum), the coloration of lycra viscose fabric was investigated; the ideal
dye extraction conditions were as follows: an M:L ratio of 1:3, a temperature of 80 °C, and a duration of 30 min. For viscose fabric, several dyeing processes
were performed utilizing natural mordants, such as orange peel and lemon peel, as well as commonly used tannic acid, copper sulfate, and ferrous sulfate
with various mordanting ratios. In the entire experiment, for the first time, only one type of mordanting procedure (pre-mordanting) was used to determine
the optimal outcomes of the mordants and to provide a comparison of their performances. The results revealed that viscose fabric dyeing using a premordanting method with 5% orange peel as a natural mordant exhibited improved performance and higher outcomes than the other mordants. Different
measurement techniques were used to determine the CIELab outputs, and a color strength (K/S) attribute experiment was used to determine the optimal
value. The results from the FTIR study verified that the colored particles interacted with the viscose fabric. In addition, the results from the SEM analysis
confirmed the ability of the dye to absorb into the viscose fabric surface. The elemental mapping and EDX spectra also confirmed the presence of the dye
particles on the surface of the dyed fabric. In addition, the color-fastness characteristics had satisfactory fastness ratings of 4–5 for rubbing, 4–5 for washing,
and 4–5 for light performance with the metal mordants. To address the actual need for viscose fabric coloration and function in clothing manufacturing,
garlic (Allium sativum) dyeing of viscose fabric is a very promising alternative option to synthetic dyestuff.

Mechanical and Thermal Properties of Synthetic/Synthetic Fibers in Hybrid Non-woven Fabric
Thermoplastic Composites
Innovations in Woven and Non-woven Fabrics Based Laminated Composites, Composites Science and Technology, Springer, 17 December 2024, pp 213–233.
Online Link: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-97-7937-6_9

This chapter focuses on the mechanical and thermal properties of synthetic fibers in hybrid non-woven fabric polymeric composites. In the nonwoven
industry, synthetic fibers are extensively utilized, with natural fibers playing a lesser role due to impurities and higher costs. The production of nonwovens
involves arranging small fibers in sheets or webs, which are then bound together using mechanical or thermal techniques. The most commonly used synthetic
fibers in this industry are polyester (PET), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), as well as specialty fibers such as glass and carbon. PET nonwoven fabric
exhibits exceptional mechanical strength and can withstand high temperatures without degradation. Non-woven polypropylene fabric is held together
through the mechanical, thermal, and chemical entanglement of fibers, resulting in a resilient and long-lasting material. The current invention focuses on
polyethylene nonwoven fabric made of fine fibers with a small diameter, which exhibits excellent formation properties and finds applications in sanitary and
household items. Fiberglass nonwoven fabric is a soft and resilient material composed of fine glass fibers. Carbon fibers offer advantageous qualities
including good thermal and electrical conductivities, excellent creep resistance, low density, high thermal stability in the absence of oxidizing agents, and
exceptional tensile strength. To conclude, this chapter provides insights into the mechanical and thermal properties of synthetic fibers used in hybrid nonwoven fabric polymeric composites. Additionally, it presents an overview of the diverse applications of these fibers in the nonwoven industry, further
highlighting their significance and utility.

Mechanical and Thermal Properties of Plant/Synthetic Fibers in Hybrid Woven/Non-woven
Fabric Polymeric Laminates
Innovations in Woven and Non-woven Fabrics Based Laminated Composites, Composites Science and Technology, Springer, 17 December 2024, pp 235–255.
Online Link: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-97-7937-6_10

The objective of this chapter is to comprehensively explore the mechanical and thermal properties of hybrid woven/non-woven fabric polymeric laminates
containing plant and synthetic fibers. Fabric-based laminated composites find wide application in industries such as automotive, transportation, defense,
and structural building due to their desirable characteristics of low cost, lightweight, and good strength. In particular, the versatility of laminating materials
allows for the use of various fabric structures, including woven, nonwoven, and knit, in composite production. Among these options, hybrid composites
combining synthetic and natural fibers have gained significant attention for their adaptable tensile and impact characteristics, making them suitable for
construction purposes. Moreover, the availability of fabric components makes the production of laminated hybrids practical and cost-effective. However, a
comprehensive understanding of the effects of factors such as fiber type, origin, content, and polymeric matrix on the properties of fabric composites is still
lacking. In this chapter, we discuss the thermo-mechanical performances of plant/synthetic polymeric woven/nonwoven laminates. Additionally, we explore
the potential applications of these laminated composites, based on limited experimental findings available. Through this analysis, we aim to provide
conclusive insights into the mechanical and thermal behavior of hybrid fabric polymeric laminates and their suitability for various applications.
